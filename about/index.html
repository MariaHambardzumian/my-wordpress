<p style="color:#dde7ff;font-size:34px;text-align:center" class="has-text-color"><em><strong>Casa Loma</strong></em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://casaloma.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_332993603-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6782" width="563" height="563"></figure></div>



<p style="font-size:15px" class="has-text-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">Aprime example of modern Toronto’s commitment to its rich history, Casa Loma was first built in 1914 by financier Sir Henry Pellatt. The castle located in midtown Toronto, is now owned by the City of Toronto and is regarded as a treasured heritage landmark.Today, Casa Loma is one of Toronto’s top tourist attractions and hospitality venues. Each year over 350,000 visitors tour Casa Loma and the estate gardens. A perfect backdrop for special occasions, Casa Loma also plays host to over 250 private events annually. The unique architecture has also made it a highly desirable location for film, television and photo shoots.<br></p>



<p style="color:#a9b2c1;font-size:15px" class="has-text-color">The historic site is operated by the Liberty Entertainment Group; under the direction of Nick Di Donato, a company synonymous with Toronto entertainment venues. Hospitality, as well as a flair for the restoration in heritage buildings.</p>



<p style="color:#a9b2c1;font-size:15px" class="has-text-color">Casa Loma as a Special Event Venues Toronto<br>Casa Loma was named the Best Venue in North America by BizBash in 2016. The operational takeover by Liberty Entertainment Group commenced in 2014 and since then improvements to the treasured landmark have been substantial. Upgrades include: full air conditioning, state-of-the-art AV, a cutting edge theatre and a seasonal outdoor event space. Liberty Group’s catering and events team are seasoned event professionals, making sure every event pulls together seamlessly.<br><br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://casaloma.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f1244_it4013-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-613" width="273" height="341"></figure></div>



<p style="font-size:15px" class="has-text-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">Sir Henry Pellatt, the dreamer behind Toronto’s famous heritage site; Casa Loma, was born to his British parents in Kingston, Ontario on January 6, 1859. &nbsp;Ambitious from his youth, Sir Henry Pellatt left his studies at Upper Canada College when he was seventeen to pursue a career in commerce in the family business. By the age of twenty-three, he became a full partner in his father’s stock brokerage firm Pellatt and Pellatt. That year was also marked by his marriage to Mary Dodgeson, whom he met when he was twenty. <br>Even as a young man, Henry Pellatt embraced the spirit of the family motto “Devant Si Je Puis” or “Foremost If I Can”. When he met his bride-to-be, Sir Pellatt had already achieved local renown in 1879 for beating the U. S. amateur champion of the one mile race. Travels to Europe gave him the love for fine art and architecture, which would spur his vision of Casa Loma-“House on the Hill.” This romantic side was mirrored by his other lifelong passion-his involvement with the military, specifically the Queen’s Own Rifles. <br>Even as a young man, Henry Pellatt embraced the spirit of the family motto “Devant Si Je Puis” or “Foremost If I Can”.

<p style="font-size:15px" class="has-text-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">As a partner in Pellatt and Pellatt; Sir Henry Pellatt was a business visionary. In the same year that Thomas Edison developed steam-generated electricity, Sir Henry Pellatt realized that supplying electricity could be extremely profitable. He founded the Toronto Electric Light Company in 1883. By the time he was thirty, the Toronto Electric Light Company enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of street lighting to the city of Toronto. In 1892 his father retired, enabling Sir Henry Pellatt to invest with more risk. Despite vigorous discouragement from his friends, he purchased stock in the Canadian Pacific Railroad and in the North West Land Company. As with steam-generated electricity, his intuition was right on target. A liberal immigration policy led to the opening of the Canadian West which led to healthy profits from his investments in both the Canadian Pacific Railroad and in the North West Land Company. By 1901, Sir Henry Pellatt was chairman of twenty-one Canadian companies with interests in mining, insurance, land and electricity. In 1902, he and his partners won the rights to build the first Canadian hydro-generating plant at Niagara Falls. He was knighted in 1905 for his military service with the Queen’s Own Rifles. Sir Henry Pellatt’s Midas touch continued through most of his business life. In 1911, armed with a fortune of $17M, Sir Pellatt drew up plans with Canadian architect E.J. Lennox to build his dream home, a castle in the city of Toronto. The land on which he planned to build had been given the name Casa Loma by its previous owner, a name that in Spanish translates to ‘Hill House’, Pellatt must have known it was meant for a home. </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://casaloma.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f1244_it4014.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="285"></figure></div>



<p style="font-size:15px" class="has-text-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">Casa Loma took three years and $3.5M to build. Sir Henry Pellatt filled Casa Loma with priceless artwork from Canada and around the world. Casa Loma stood as a monument to its creator – it surpassed any private home in North America. With soaring battlements and secret passageways, it paid homage to the castles and knights of days gone by. To this day it remains one of the only true castles in North America. Sir Henry Pellatt’s numerous business and military connections demanded entertaining on a large scale. Casa Loma’s romantic borrowing from the past, tempered by necessary modern day conveniences, provided the perfect setting. In the height of their years at Casa Loma, the planning of such a busy social calendar consumed much of Lady Pellatt’s time. In addition to hosting grand social events, the Pellatt’s were involved in a number of philanthropic projects. Sir Henry Pellatt was a trustee and benefactor of Trinity College and a strong supporter of Grace Hospital. The organization of the St. John’s Ambulance Brigade in Canada is due largely to his efforts. Lady Pellatt, in spite of her frail health, played an active role in the promotion of Girl Guides of Canada. She was appointed the first Commissioner of the Girl Guides of Canada and in 1919 was honoured with the Girl Guides highest award, the Silver Fish Award. </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://casaloma.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f1266_it12724.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="274"></figure></div>



<p style="font-size:15px" class="has-text-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">Sir Henry Pellatt left Casa Loma in 1924. In 1925, one year after Sir Henry Pellatt retired to his farm in King, Ontario; architect William Sparling put forward a proposal to convert the Casa Loma house to a Toronto luxury hotel; The Casa Loma Hotel which was open from 1926 – 1929. William Sparling was granted a long-term lease and began the process of completing the Great Hall and the Billiard Room, areas that Sir Henry Pellatt had never finished. He also had plans to add two large wings to the east and west sections of the main building that would each contain ninety-six full suites and fifty-six rooms. These wings were never built. A New York syndicate offered to purchase Casa Loma in 1928 but the deal was never completed and the hotel failed in 1929. During the late 1920’s, Casa Loma was also a popular nightspot. The Orange Blossoms, later known as Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra, were booked to play for eight months at Casa Loma in 1927 and 1928. Shortly thereafter, they went on tour of North America with their big band sound. With the onset of the Depression, Casa Loma once again remained vacant. In 1933, the City of Toronto took ownership of the property for $27,303.45 owed in back taxes. Suggestions for possible uses of the building included a highschool, museum or art gallery for visitors to Toronto, a war veteran’s convalescence home and a permanent residence for the Dionne quintuplets. None of the projects proved feasible and the City of Toronto considered demolishing North America’s Castle.Thus, it remained vacant from 1933 – 1937 while proposals were considered by the City of Toronto for the future use. Instead The Kiwanis Club of West Toronto began operating Casa Loma as a tourist attraction in 1937. This agreement continued until 2011. In August 2011, the new Casa Loma Corporation was formed. The City of Toronto remains the sole owner of the property. </p>

A perfect backdrop for special occasions, Casa Loma also plays host to over 250 private functions, weddings and special events annually. The unique architecture has also made it a highly sought-after and unique location for film, television and photo shoots.<br>In January 2014, The city of Toronto awarded the long-term lease of the historic Casa Loma to Liberty Entertainment Group.<br>Liberty Entertainment Group operates Toronto’s Castle as a unique special event facility as well as maintaining and enhancing the tourism and Toronto attractions grand experience.<br>Liberty Entertainment Group’s President &amp; CEO; Nick Di Donato continues to prove his commitment to preserve this historic Toronto attraction, with numerous improvements already made to enhance the event and dining experience; he also plans to integrate new technology for school and even more cultural programming.<br>For over three decades the Liberty Entertainment Group, led by Nick Di Donato, has been redefining Toronto and Miami’s restaurant, nightlife and special event experience.
